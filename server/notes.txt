!! To navigate through the server directory, 
write the command in the terminal --> npm init -y
this is going to initialisse an empty package json.
Now we will be able to install all the necessary dependencies.

!! npm install body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon
 *body-parser --> this is going to enable us to send post requests.
 *express --> framework for creating the routing of our application.
 *mongoose --> to create models for our posts.
 *nodemon --> so that we dont have to manually reset the server everytime we make a change.

!! Now after this import the dependencies in index.js
After successfully writing the import code in the index.js file,
we need to do one small thing in the package.json file
add one line below the main index.js --> "type": "module",

!! After this, delete the test script and add start script.
"start": "nodemon index.js"
