!! For starting the react application, give the command 
npx create-react-app ./

!! After successfully installing react application, we can go ahead and type
npm install axios moment react-file-base64 redux redux-thunk
 * axios--> we are using axios for making api request.
 * moment--> is a library for working with time and date.
 * react-file-base64--> use to convert our images.
 * redux-thunk --> is used for asynchronous actions using redux

!! In the index.js file of client server, we will connect the react application
to index.html file. So, import react from react.
After importing the necessary things in the index.js file along with the app component. 
We will create an App.js file where we will add simple functional component.
Import -> react and create a component const App = () => {}
export default App;

!! To run the application we need to type --- npm start.
For closing we need to give ctrl+C.
We did this bcoz we need to setup our backend.
* connect to the databse
* create a mongodb cluster
* set up the models
* create some documents

!! npm install @material-ui/core
This is going to be ui kit we will be using.
Material ui is quite popular when working with react because it allows you to create a
nice looking application without lot of styling.
