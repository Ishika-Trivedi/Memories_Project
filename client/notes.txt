!! For starting the react application, give the command 
npx create-react-app ./

!! After successfully installing react application, we can go ahead and type
npm install axios moment react-file-base64 redux redux-thunk
 * axios--> we are using axios for making api request.
 * moment--> is a library for working with time and date.
 * react-file-base64--> use to convert our images.
 * redux-thunk --> is used for asynchronous actions using redux

!! In the index.js file of client server, we will connect the react application
to index.html file. So, import react from react.
After importing the necessary things in the index.js file along with the app component. 
We will create an App.js file where we will add simple functional component.
Import -> react and create a component const App = () => {}
export default App;

!! To run the application we need to type --- npm start.
For closing we need to give ctrl+C.
We did this bcoz we need to setup our backend.
* connect to the databse
* create a mongodb cluster
* set up the models
* create some documents

!! npm install @material-ui/core
This is going to be ui kit we will be using.
Material ui is quite popular when working with react because it allows you to create a
nice looking application without lot of styling.

!! Now, in app.js file we are going to import all the components which we are going to use.
For images, we need to create a new folder in the src and save the image with .png and then import 
the image from the folder.
Below the appbar, we will give grow component which usually provides some simple animations.

!! After this just create a post and form.js file and then export it.
The exported file is then imported into the app.js file.

!! Now its time for the styling.
How we can properly add styles to a material ui application?
Inside src folder create a style.js file. Then we have to import
import {makeStyles} from '@material-ui/core/styles';

!! After this import all the styles in the form and post file.
The frontend is ready.

!! Now, start implementing the calls to the api.
In the client module, in src folder we will create a new folder called api.
Inside api folder we are going to have an index.js file.
const url = "http://localhost:5000/posts"; 
This is the url pointing to our backend route and this simply returns all the posts which we have in our database.
Now, we have to create a function that is going to simply call our axios.get(url).

!! Now we should focus on adding redux capabilities.
ALl actions towards our backend are going to be done using redux.
Adding redux makes our application scalable in the long term application.

!! Now, in main index.js file we will initialise redux.
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
 *Provider:- keeps the track of that store which is that global state and that allows us to 
access that store from anywhere inside of the app.
Now we are going to import {createStore, applyMiddleware, compose} from 'redux';
Finally we need to import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

!! To set redux, we first have to create store. This takes in two different things.
const store = createStore(reducers, compose(applyMiddleware(thunk)));
Now we need to import reducers.
import reducers from './reducers';

!! What is  a reducer?
Well.a reducer is a function more specifically it is equal to a function that accepts the state
and also it accepts the action.
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    // based on the action type
    if(action.type = 'CREATE'){
        // Some logic.
    }
    for more clarity we will prefer switch statement.
}
In switch statement we are going to have all our actions like we know we are going to fetch all our posts
so case 'FETCH_ALL': case 'CREATE':
and one for crating the post.
Our post is going to be an array. That's y state [].
We will use this reducers in the index.js file.

!! With the provider we will wrap our component.
Our application is now successfully using redux.
